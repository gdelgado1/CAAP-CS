            <b>Books Collective Organization</b> (B.O.C.) may be relatively new but we have participated in several important events and made strides in our local city of Chicago, Illinois and surrounding states.Where can your school, library, or community group find free or low-cost books for kids? There are a number of national organizations as well as local programs you can turn to for help filling the shelves of your library, classroom, or literacy program and putting books into the hands and homes of young readers.

    <h3>Schools Outreach</h3>
        <p>

            We have provided brand new textbooks to Stony Brook High School, Middleburg Middle School, Caltra Middle School, Weeping Willow Elementary and more. 
        </p>
    <h3>Familial Specific Outreach Through Edu. Defecit Program</h3>
        <p>
            Through our recent Education Defecit Program, we have had the pleasure of helping several families in the Chicago area who experience a difficulty of attaining educational materials. The Wilkins and Raterford Families have submitted their stories which will be soon accessible on our webpage.
