        I was born on <b>August 9, 1997</b>. I attended the <i>University of Chicago</i> and graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Literature and Philosophy. I had intended to pursue my Masters in Education, after several years of traveling and various jobs, before I discovered something shocking in the American education system and the communities around me. I realized there was an ever-increasing gap in the learning system. Children were not reading at age-level and families could not afford tutoring or books to read amongst themselves. Due to the Paper Crisis, books had become a more expensive commodity and families couldn't afford them. That's why I developed this organization to respond to the issues growing in our country.
