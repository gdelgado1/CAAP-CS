Task 6
I used gitcommit --amend -m as a shortcut and recieved help from Jose to do so. I also found this on github.com
 All fish versions from the very beginning though used a variable called simply  to store their version, so that is the one that should be used.

commit e67cc75063d0a1a2e7aa6090a3d9845d517ed5c2. I could not locate the accurate SHA as there was some type of FISH version
I used git diff to locate the change when I git added to READMe.txt
Task 9 I used git revert with the appropraite SHA.
For Task 10 I also used the same mechanism but it can be done git reset --soft HEAD~1 I believe. I found this and most of the git commands on Stackoverflow.com
